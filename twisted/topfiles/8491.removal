The following scripts were removed from the bin directory:
 - cftp
 - ckeygen
 - conch
 - mailmail
 - pyhtmlizer
 - tkconch
 - trial
 - twistd

These scripts are now generated by setup.py using the console_scripts
entry point.  During installation, setup.py will install the
generated scripts into the appropriate bin directory.

It is possible to generate the scripts into the bin directory
to facilitate development on Twisted itself by doing:

python setup.py develop --script-dir ./bin
